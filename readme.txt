This plugin updates jQuery to the latest stable version on your website.

== Description ==
This plugin updates [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to the latest official stable version, which is most likely not available within the latest stable release of WordPress.
Since jQuery 2+ was used in this plugin, making jQuery 1.x obsolete, [jQuery Migrate](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin) is also included.

No files are replaced, therefore deactivation of this plugin returns your site to it`s original state.

**Warning**

If you are not familiar with beta testing, bugfixing, javascript or running bleeding edge software it`s **not** recommended.
I will not provide help on JavaScript and jQuery!

**Reporting problems**

Please post bug reports and request for help on [WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jquery-updater). I will only provide help on issues caused by the plugin, not on JavaScript and jQuery related matters!
Please report feature requests and code changes on [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Ramoonus/jQuery-Updater/issues)

If you run into any bugs, turning this plugin off will fully deactivate everything.

**Work in Progress**

* Options screen to enable/disable
* Option to choose a specific jQuery version
* Automatic cache flushing

jQuery 2.0 has the same API as jQuery 1.9, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8. All the notes in the jQuery 1.9 Upgrade Guide apply here as well. Since IE 6/7/8 are still relatively common, we recommend using the 1.x version unless you are certain no IE 6/7/8 users are visiting the site.
